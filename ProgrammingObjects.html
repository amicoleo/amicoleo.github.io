			<p class="project-info-title">overview</p>
			<p class="project-description">What if objects were produced the way open source software is developed?</p>

			<p>Creating software has become a flexible, collaborative, and adaptable process: projects develop as code is openly shared, reviewed, adapted, and distributed. Simultaneously, home appliances are increasingly dependent on inflexible standards of production leading to a lack of reparability, less adaptability, and more waste. With affordable technologies of digital manufacturing and electronic platforms, translating code into matter is becoming possible for everyone.</p>

			<p>Programming object thus seek to bring open source software practices into the world of (open hardware) appliances. Moving away from a top-down approach from corporation to consumer, to one where objects are designed, developed, and produced democratically within open communities.</p>

			<br><p class="project-info-title">information</p>

			<p>I was selected to join a research team 
			around the theme "Hacking Households", whose starting point was to explore how open source design, personal fabrication and DIY electronics could be used for rethinking the production of household appliances.</p>
			<p>The project was funded by MAO, the Museum of Architecture and Design of Ljublana (Slovenia) for BIO50, the 24th Biennale of Design, curated by Jan Boelen.</p>
			<p>Programming Objects is the result of a collaborative work that lasted 6 months. During this time the team met six times, while most part of the work happened online. Skype calls were made, <a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5567/14923725420_2f64d778f7_o.jpg" target="_blank">Muraly boards</a> were sketched, <a href="https://medium.com/@orgonomyprod/programming-objects-b5b042c70fe9"  target="_blank">texts</a> compiled, 3D Design files shared, and code was committed and pushed.</p>

			<br><p class="project-info-title">design + technology</p>

			<p>With Programming Objects our goal was to bring Open Source software development practices in the world of house appliances. Thus making extensive use of reusable modules (libraries) and adapting software the practice of forking for an evolutionary system of objects. For the exhibition we designed and realized a collection of objects built around a set of reusable parts, each of these block composed of an electronic module inside a 3D printed case.</p>

			<p>My technical role in the team was expecially to take care of electronics and code: finding components for the modular parts and making the appliances to actually function. Furthermore we wanted to acknowledge current technological trends, thus our system had to include smart and IoT functionalities.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.spark.io" target="_blank">Sparkcore</a> technology provided a neat choice for embedding "intelligence" in our objects and was fitting the conceptual guidelines of the project. It is Open Source Hardware, Arduino compatible, inexpensive and Wi-Fi enabled. Using this technology we realized a gesture controlled fan (a fan controlled by waving an hand in front of it) and an internet connected fan (a fan that can controlled remotely from a web interface).</p>
