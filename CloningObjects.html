			<p class="project-info-title">overview</p>
			<p class="project-description">How can an object control its own reproduction? Cloning objects is a family of inspectable products that contain all digital information for their own fabrication.</p>


			<p>The information surrounding the production of a typical product tends to be quite guarded: plans and techniques are protected by patent and “owned” as the intellectual property of a single company or manufacturer. Cloning Objects presents an alternative scenario in which a collection of products are each embedded with all of the information needed for their own reproduction.</p>

			<p>Scanning the object with a software interface allows a user to “inspect” the components of an object, revealing the digital 3D-definition, files for reproduction with digital fabrication tools, information and schematics for electronic components, and the source-code for any software used to control the object.</p>

			<p>Distributing this information within the objects allows them to be reproduced and distributed without a structured, formal network. The autonomous objects and their components are made accessible on an individual level, and can be freely shared, modified, and redistributed.</p>

			<!-- <br><p class="project-info-title">information</p>

			<p>Patch of Sky is a self-initiated project started at Fabrica initially as a collaboration between me and graphic designer Akshataa Vishwanath and later involving other designers and creatives at Fabrica.</p>

			<p>This project first started with a workshop that design firm <a href="http://blog.bergcloud.com/" target="_blank">BERG</a> (R.I.P.) held at Fabrica in Summer 2013. The workshop was part of a collaboration between the two studios with the goal of using Fabrica as sandbox for BERG's new project BERGCloud, an hardware and software solution for the internet of things</p>

			<p>Drawing from discussion sparked during the workshop, we began to think about some product that would take full advantage of the services and social presence available on the internet.
			This object would integrate with and extend the online world, rather than use it solely as a network infrastructure for connecting far away things.</p>

			<br><p class="project-info-title">design + technology</p>
			<p>Main inspiration for Patch of Sky came from our working place. Fabrica hosts designers and artists from all over the world, thus distance and nostalgia are naturally recurring topics. “How’s the weather there?” is a common question that parents, friends and partners ask over the phone, this is how they try to get a sense of the world distant ones are living while away. Drawing from this conversations we had the idea of Patch of Sky, an object that would silently connect people over distance, just by letting them “share the sky” under which they’re living in.</p>


			<p>The Patch of Sky prototypes use Arduino and BERGCloud shield for connecting to the web, while custom electronics and the <a href="https://github.com/fabricacode/arduinoLightAnimation" target="_blank">Arduino Light Animation</a> library are used for controlling the a RGB led strip. A Python web application handles linking of a Patch of Sky with a Facebook account. Weather at the user's location is then retrieved using Weather Undergroud API and sent to the paired Patch of Sky object through BERGCloud API.</p> -->
