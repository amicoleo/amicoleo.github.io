Tech stuff
-------

+ When set project from hash, use same animation used for moving between sections
+ SetProjectFromHash makes load the project html twice
+ With ghostery and adblocks pages with youtube and vimeo are slowed down (a lot)


Navigation 
	+ Blank href on links messes with the hash navigation. Need to put dynamic href with javascript 
Projects
+ Message Box? 
+ Patch of Sky
+ Hacking Households (change name to programming objects)
+ Future Governament Services
+ Stone Pad

+ Images
	+ On desktop cursor becomes an arrow
	+ On touch devices clicking on images will increment the counter
	+ Put the counter below the image instead of Previous/Next links

+ Orgonomy opening 

+ Find the font solution (that I sent to Tim already)

+ Scrolling bar on the right - no 

+ 


Tim questions
--------
+ Links should be different from text. Underline on hover is not enough. Cannot distinguish from other text before hovering around. And impossible to distinguish on touch devices. 

+ Possibility for "more information" link. To put a scroll inside there. So it's possible to put a lot of more stuff. 

+ Do you like the actual "more information" section? 

+ Problem with where to put my name. Idea was that homepage is "about" section. So that my information is there at first.





TODO
============
+ Blank href on links (so that they look touchable) and a link everywhere - OK
+ On touch previous project/next project keeps underline - OK
+ Scroll projects with arrows and touch scroll - OK

+ Responsiveness - OK

	+ Media queries

	+ One more information top 
	+ Disable horizontal scrolling on "More information"

+ Disable href on disabled links 
+ Distinguish links from not links
	+ links are light blue
	+ underline on hover

+ Home is the the about page (here my name, short bio and contacts)
+ Take away contacts

+ On mobile touched button keeps underlined
+ Allow caching for AJAX on production. Images are heavy.
+ Gif images compression wrong
+ Set color on text highlight
+ Add back link of project when going to more information
