Tim questions
--------
+ Links should be different from text. Underline on hover is not enough. Cannot distinguish from other text before hovering around. And impossible to distinguish on touch devices. 

+ Possibility for "more information" link. To put a scroll inside there. So it's possible to put a lot of more stuff. 

Tech stuff
-------

+ When set project from hash, use same animation used for moving between sections
