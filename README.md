TODO
============
+ On mobile document is bigger then viewport
	+ Media query on bg logo size

+ On touch previous project/next project keeps underline
+ Gif images compression wrong

+ Add my name in basic menu 
+ About page
+ Contact page
+ Blank href on links (so that they look touchable)

Tim questions
--------
+ Links should be different from text. Underline on hover is not enough. Cannot distinguish from other text before hovering around. And impossible to distinguish on touch devices. 

+ Possibility for "more information" link. To put a scroll inside there. So it's possible to put a lot of more stuff. 

Tech stuff
-------

+ Use fittext.js for the background logotype. 


+ Allow caching for AJAX on production. Images are heavy. 
+ Reduce margins for text menus on small screens
+ On desktop I can do that the mouse pointer becomes an arrow
+ On touch devices scroll projects with horizontal touch-scroll
+ When set project from hash, use same animation used for moving between sections
