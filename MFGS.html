			The Museum of Future Government Services is a design-futures exhibition that took place in Dubai from the 10th to 12th February 2014, during the UAE Government Summit. The Museum explores the future of travel, healthcare, education and urban services through immersive experiences and fictional design works.</p>
			<p>

			<p>
				The exhibition was conceived and created by <a href="http://www.tellart.com" target="_blank">Tellart</a> and <a title="Fabrica" href="http://www.fabrica.it" target="_blank">Fabrica</a>, with creative consultancy of <a href="http://www.superflux.in/">Superflux</a>, <a title="Near Future Laboratory" href="http://nearfuturelaboratory.com/" target="_blank">Near Future Laboratory</a> and Noah Radford of the <a href="http://www.iftf.org/home/" target="_blank">Institute for the Future</a>.
			</p>

			<p>I was part of the Tellart/Fabrica team that realized the Home Health section, where visitors were asked to explore a possible future of healthcare, and in particular I took care of the smart mirror exhibit.</p>

			<p>The health care exhibit presented a scenario in which people's health checkup would be part of the daily home ritual. By pulling data from online services and personal health-tracking devices and by performing a series of health monitor activities, the smart mirror would give users suggestions for mantaining healty conditions.</p>

			<p>On the technology side, the installation made use of an Openframework application for controlling each location. A Kinect camera was used for tracking visitors in front of the screen and an Arduino was controlling lights in the sink and implementing a touch interface for an hand-scanner artifact.</p>
