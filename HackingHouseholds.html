			<p class="project-description">What if objects were produced the way open source software is developed?</p>
			<p>Creating software has become a flexible, collaborative, and adaptable process: projects develop as code is openly shared, reviewed, adapted, and distributed. Simultaneously, home appliances are increasingly dependent on inflexible standards of production leading to a lack of reparability, less adaptability, and more waste. With affordable technologies of digital manufacturing and electronic platforms, translating code into matter is becoming possible for everyone.</p>
			<p>Programming object thus seek to bring open source software practices into the world of (open hardware) appliances. Moving away from a top-down approach from corporation to consumer, to one where objects are designed, developed, and produced democratically within open communities.</p>

			<br><p><b>Info</b></p>

			<p>I was selected to join a research team 
			around the theme "Hacking Households", whose starting point was to explore how open source design, personal fabrication and DIY electronics could be used for rethinking the production of household appliances.</p>
			<p>The project was funded by MAO, the Museum of Architecture and Design of Ljublana (Slovenia) for BIO50, the 24th Biennale of Design, curated by Jan Boelen.</p>
			<p>Programming Objects is the result of a collaborative work that lasted 6 months. During this time the team met six times, while most part of the work happened online. Skype calls were made, Muraly moodboards were sketched, Google docs compiled, 3D Design files shared, and code was committed and pushed.</p>

			<br><p><b>Design & Technology</b></p>

			<p>With Programming Objects our goal is to bring Open Source software development practices in the world of house appliances. Thus making extensive use of reusable modules (libraries) and adapting the practice of forking into an evolutionary system of objects.<br>We realized a collection of objects built around a set of reusable parts.
